## Installation

To set up the AuthenticationSystem locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedyounes2030/AuthenticationSystem.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd AuthenticationSystem
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Make sure you have .NET 9 SDK installed. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:

   Update your `appsettings.json` file with your SQL Server connection string. Then, run the migrations:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:

   Start the application with:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through the provided API endpoints. Use tools like Postman or curl to test the endpoints.

### Example Request

To authenticate a user, send a POST request to `/api/auth/login` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

### Example Response

A successful response will return an access token and a refresh token:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "your_access_token",
  "refreshToken": "your_refresh_token"
}
```
